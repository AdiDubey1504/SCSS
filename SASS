SASS
1. Variables -
$color: #00f005

HTDUC - Where same value for a property is being used at multiple places, like the background color of buttons everywhere are same, the font-size for headings, subheadings, color of font is same

2. Sass Maps -
$colors: (
  primary: #00f005,
  secondary: #0f0f0f
)

HTDUC - Colors of different buttons - Primary, secondary, disabled, danger, warning

3. Nesting -
body {    
  color: red,    
  ul {        
    font-size: 20px    
  }
}

HTDUC - Can be shown anywhere, Navbar is a good example

4. Functions - Many different use cases
@function color($color-name) {    
  // $colors is the MAP
  @return map-get($colors, $color-name)
}
How to call -
color(primary)
* There are also pre-defined functions, have a look

5. Mixins - Many different use cases
Mixins is just some reusable piece of code. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can also pass in values to the mixins, so they're sort of a function.
How to create mixin
@mixin border($width, $color) {
  border-width: $width;
  border-color: $color;
}

How to use mixin
.box {
  @include border(2, "black");
}
* Mixins can be included in mixins also

Difference between Function and MIXIN - Function is used to return a value, so you can get a value and set it as value for a property, Mixin on the other hand allows you to add full properties, or a set of full property. Mixin and function both take parameters

6. Extensions

7. Inheritance

8. Partials - Dividing sass code into files, and including them in other files, this makes it modular. The Partials(the files) must start with an _(underscore). This makes sure that sass doesn't create a separate file for the partial, and only uses it to include in other sass files.
You can import a partial using the @use rule syntax
Ex. _base.scss file has to be imported in styles.scss
In styles.scss
@use 'base';


9. Placeholder classes - 7. Inheritance - Same thing
prints only when extended with the @extend rule
* Simply borrowing, extending styles from one class into another, like a parent and child class

10. Operators -
+, -, *, /, and, or

11. How to add media queries
